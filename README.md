# Web Page Game: Guess My Number!

## 1) Fundamental Game Mechanics

The javascript backend generates a secret hidden integer between 0 and 20. The objective of the game is for the user to guess this number, via trial and error, whilst achieving the highest score possible (i.e. misguessing as infrequently as possible).
